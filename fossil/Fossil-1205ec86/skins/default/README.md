This skin was originally contributed by Étienne Deparis on 2015-02-22,
promoted to the default on 2015-03-14, and subsequently changed by many:

In February 2024, a sufficiently large set of changes were made to the
skin that we forked the old version for the benefit of those who needed
to reference the old one — as when migrating custom skin changes to work
atop the new default — or who simply preferred it.  See ../etienne.
