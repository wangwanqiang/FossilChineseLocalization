This skin was contributed by Ã‰tienne Deparis.

It was promoted to the default from 2015-03-14 until February 2024, when
it was forked into this location for use by those who do not want the
large number of changes merged into trunk at that time.  Even if you
agree with us that the changes improve readability, you may prefer to
pack more information onto the screen at the expense of readability.
Other reasons to choose this fork are to migrate custom skin changes to
work atop the new base, or to make a comparative design evaluation.

A bare minimum of changes have been made to this fork, primarily to
allow this skin to render the Fossil documentation in a readable
fashion. The intent is that you be able to toggle between these two
skins at will.
