<h1>Content Security Policy Test</h1>

<p>If the content-security-policy is ineffective, a pop-up dialog
box will appears.  If there is no dialog box, then CSP is working
correctly.</p>

<script>alert('Content Security Policy is ineffective');</script>
<img src='/' onerror='alert("CSP is ineffective")'>

<p>As a double-check, open the Developer Console in your web-browser
and verify that two CSP violations were detected and blocked.</p>
