# Beware of Content-Type and Encoding...

When posting data to fossil, make sure that the request sends:

-   **Content-Type** of `application/json`. Fossil also (currently)
    accepts `application/javascript` and `text/plain` as JSON input,
    but `application/json` is preferred. The client may optionally
    send `;charset=utf-8` with the Content-Type, but any other
    encoding produces undefined results. Behaviour without the charset
    or with `;charset=utf-8` suffix is identical.
-   **POST data must be an non-form-encoded JSON string**
    (ASCII or UTF-8). jQuery, by default, form-urlencodes it, which the
    fossil json bits cannot read. e.g. post the result of
    `JSON.stringify(requestObject)`, without any additional encoding on
    top of it.
-   **When POSTing via jQuery**, set these AJAX options:
    -   `contentType:'application/json'`
    -   `dataType:'text'`
    -   `data:JSON.stringify(requestObject)`
-   **When POSTing via XMLHttpRequest** (XHR), be sure to:
    -   `xhr.open( â€¦ )`
    -   `xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")`
    -   `xhr.send( JSON.stringify( requestObject ) )`

The response will be (except in the case of an HTTP 500 error or
similar) a JSON or JSONP string, ready to be parsed by your favourite
`JSON.parse()` implementation or `eval()`'d directly.

## Using `curl` and `wget`

Both [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) and
[wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) can be used to post data to
this API from the command line or scripts, but both require an extra
parameter to set the request encoding.

Example:

```console
$ cat x.json
{
"payload": {
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM reportfmt limit 1",
  "format": "o"
  }
}

# Fossil has been started locally with:
#   fossil server --localauth
# which allows the following requests to work without extra
# authenticaion:

$ wget -q -O- \
  --post-file=x.json \
  --header="Content-Type: application/json" \
  'http://localhost:8080/json/query'

$ curl \
  --data-binary @x.json \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  'http://localhost:8080/json/query'
```

The relevant parts for encoding are the `--header` flag for `wget` and
`curl`, noting that they have different syntaxes for each
(`--header=X` vs `--header X`).

# Example JavaScript (Browser and Shell)

In the fossil source tree, [in the ajax directory](/dir/ajax), is test/demo code
implemented in HTML+JavaScript. While it is still quite experimental, it
demonstrates one approach to creating client-side wrapper APIs for
remote Fossil/JSON repositories.

There is some additional JS test code, which uses the Rhino JS engine
(i.e. from the console, not the browser), under
[`ajax/i-test`](/dir/ajax/-itest). That adds a Rhino-based connection
back-end to the AJAJ API and uses it for running integration-style
tests against an arbitrary JSON-capable repository.
